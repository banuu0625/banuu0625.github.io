    For a school project, I've decided to design chess playing programs using Deep Learning (DL) Algorithms ! It was my first AI project ever,
    therefore, I am very pleased with the results ! Using a Convolutional Neural Network, the AI is able to choose the best move based on the chess 
    board state. This project gave me an introduction into Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. I am really looking forward to specify mself into
    AI, since this might be the future of the world. GUI was made using pygame! It was both a fun and rewarding expercience!
